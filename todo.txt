	* add ability to call C functions (used to be through VT_FUNCPTR)
	* make io more robust
	* make parse more robust
	* change parser to parse (func args) syntax?
	* add definable types to value?
	* change ERR names
	* Add quoted strings
	* change SDRL_ET_NAME to SDRL_ET_STRING ???? (should they be the same/distinct)
	* add _s struct notation? (probably not)

	* should printing functions be included throughout code?  or perhaps in a special print module?
	* do and test sdrl (uses parse, bingings and dependancies)
	* do and test prims (uses sdrl and dependancies)

	* Finish Conversion of types
	* Add Special Binding flag that specifies whether to call the function with args or params
	* make execution use a tail-recursion stack thingy
	* make the parser parse syntactic sugary goodness
	* make the parser modifiable by the code itself
	* add cross-cutting language constructs (aspects?)
