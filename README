SDRL Release 0.3
2007/12/23

This is a long long overdue release but it is somewhat rushed.  It was intended
that most of these changes would be released approximately two years ago but
interst in the project dropped.  See changelog.txt for details of changes.

Compiling:
	cd src/sdrl
	make

	There is no install.  Only one file (sdrl) is produced.
	Copy this to somewhere in your path.

Using SDRL in a project:
	Include the file <sdrl/sdrl.h> into your project and
	when compiling, run make in core, compile any files in
	lib/ and then link libsdrl.a and the compiled lib/ files
	into your source project.  (In the next release I hope to
	make this easier).  Look at src/sdrl/Makefile for hints.

	Look in doc/ for the list of functions available to a
	program and look through the prims.c library for details
	on making your own C library functions.
