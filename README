SDRL Release 0.2

See changelog.txt for details of changes.  (Note: this release is
incomatible with SDRL Release 0.1).

Compiling:
	cd src/sdrl
	make

	There is no install.  Only one file (sdrl) is produced.
	Copy this to somewhere in your path.

Using SDRL in a project:
	Include the file (src/core/)sdrl.h into your project and
	when compiling, run make in core, compile any files in
	lib/ and then link libsdrl.a and the compiled lib/ files
	into your source project.  (In the next release I hope to
	make this easier).  Look at src/sdrl/Makefile for hints.

	Look in doc/ for the list of functions available to a
	program and look through the prims.c library for details
	on making your own C library functions.
